# Simple Webpage Template

This is a basic template for a single-page website.

It uses Prettier to auto-format code and ESLint to see code errors.
Husky and lint-staged are used to ensure Prettier and ESLint are executed on changed source code before submitted.

## Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `styles.css`: CSS styles
- `script.js`: JavaScript file

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the page.
